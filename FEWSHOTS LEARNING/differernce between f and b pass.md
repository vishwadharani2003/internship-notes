differernce between f and b pass
**Forward Pass:**

- **Definition**: The forward pass involves computing the output of the neural network for a given input. This means that the input data is passed through each layer of the network, where various computations like matrix multiplications, application of activation functions, and other operations take place.
- **Purpose**: The goal of the forward pass is to obtain the predicted output (like classification scores) which is then used to calculate the loss (error) when compared to the true labels.
- **In Few-Shot Learning**: The forward pass is crucial because it often involves specialized layers and mechanisms that handle the limited data available. For example, in prototypical networks, this is where the computation of prototypes for each class happens.

**Backward Pass:**

- **Definition**: The backward pass, or backpropagation, is the process of computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter (weight) of the network. This involves applying the chain rule to find these gradients, propagating the error backwards through the network.
- **Purpose**: Once the gradients are computed, they are used to update the network's weights with the aim of reducing the loss in the subsequent iteration, thereby improving the model's predictions.
- **In Few-Shot Learning**: In the backward pass for few-shot learning, the gradients are computed with respect to not only the network's parameters but sometimes also with respect to the computed prototypes or other few-shot-specific parameters. This helps in fine-tuning the model's ability to classify new examples from very little data.
