coding -> arrays and hashing
dynamic array
-  hash map
	- what are the properties of hash function
	- it should be deterministic->tdy when we add 2 and 2 it will be always giving the answer as 4 tmr it wont be changing hence hash function should be deterministic
	- ![[Pasted image 20240125175746.png]] this is called collision like i already have value in 2 hence when i mod 12 , will again get 2 hence it collide
	- one of the way to handle collision is linear throbing:

	- asymtotic notation : is the notion where we compare 2 approaches
